				I used to edit on a variety of programs and apps since 2018. I started on Powerdirector App, then Cute Cut Pro, Kinemaster, and now, Sony Vegas.
				<br>
				<br>
				The moment I knew that I love editing was when I discovered to myself that I enjoy editing videos. The excitement that I get whenever I get to do the transition, effects, and such that I wanted to project, and the like. Surely those who share the same passion with me will understand what I meant from that :D
				<br>
				<br>
				I mainly edit AMV's or what's known as "Animated Music Video". in here, you find a good music that will suit to the atmosphere to the anime, or the song that you like that you think will fit to the anime. Anything is possible to be honest since you're the one who'll be editing it!
				<br>
				<br>
				Below is an example of some of my AMV's that I've done in the past:
				<br>
				<br>
				1. Lately AMV
				<br>
				<br>
				<video width=50% controls muted>

				2. Ivana AMV
				<br>
				<br>
				<video width=50% controls muted>
					<source src="Shikimori AMV Ivana.mp4">
				</video>
				<br>
				<br>
				3. Levitating AMV
				<br>
				<br>
				<video width=50% controls muted>
					<source src="Levitating AMV Kawasegawa.mp4">
				</video>
				<br>
				<br>
				and yes, I do have a youtube channel dedicated to my AMVs only. It's named "ReAMV" :D
